Waves node is a host connected to the blockchain network with the following functions:

- Processing and validation of [transactions](https://docs.waves.tech/en/blockchain/transaction/transaction-validation)
- Generation and storage of [blocks](https://docs.waves.tech/en/blockchain/block/)
- Network communication with [other nodes](https://docs.waves.tech/en/blockchain/blockchain/#node)
- [REST API](https://docs.waves.tech/en/waves-node/node-api/)
- [Extensions](https://docs.waves.tech/en/waves-node/extensions/) management

Learn more about Waves Node in the [documentation](https://docs.waves.tech/en/waves-node/).

## üöÄÔ∏è TL;DR Modified Node by P√ºtti

This node is modified for special purposes.

Make sure you get the IP/Port config right in node/src/main/scala/com/wavesplatform/utx/UtxPoolImpl.scala
Other configuration has to be done in waves-official.conf  

Compile as follows
```bash
sbt packageAll
```

You can run it by
```bash 
java -jar node/target/waves-all*.jar ~/_blockchaindata/Waves_own/waves-official.conf                                  
```

Ctrl + C sends a shutdown signal so the node will shut down gracefully during the next couple of seconds.
Force-closing or crashing the node will result in a broken bloom-filter which the node has to rebuild on the next start (time-intensive!)

### In case you start from scratch and need some prerequisites:
Install sbt (see below)
Install libtool-bin (?)

Make sure you have ZeroMQ installed 
```bash
sudo wget http://download.zeromq.org/zeromq-2.2.0.tar.gz && tar -xvf zeromq-2.2.0.tar.gz && cd zeromq-2.2.0 && ./autogen.sh && ./configure && make -j 4 && make check && make install
```
and Java JDK of version 8.
```bash
sudo apt install default-jdk 
```

## Troubleshooting
Executing the .jar files sometimes results in a strange error about forbidden characters. 
```
"[...] Reserved character '!' is not allowed outside quote [...]"
```

Just recompile the whole project as follows:
```bash
sbt clean
sbt packageAll
```

## üöÄÔ∏è Getting started

A quick introduction of the minimal setup you need to get a running node. 

*Prerequisites:*
- configuration file for a needed network from [here](https://github.com/wavesplatform/Waves/tree/HEAD/node)
- `waves-all*.jar` file from [releases](https://github.com/wavesplatform/Waves/releases) 

Linux systems:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jre
java -jar node/target/waves-all*.jar path/to/config/waves-{network}.conf
```

Mac systems (assuming already installed homebrew):
```bash
brew cask install adoptopenjdk/openjdk/adoptopenjdk8
java -jar node/target/waves-all*.jar path/to/config/waves-{network}.conf
```

Windows systems (assuming already installed OpenJDK 8):
```bash
java -jar node/target/waves-all*.jar path/to/config/waves-{network}.conf
```

Using docker, follow the [official image documentation](https://hub.docker.com/r/wavesplatform/wavesnode).

> More details on how to install a node for different platforms you can [find in the documentation](https://docs.waves.tech/en/waves-node/how-to-install-a-node/how-to-install-a-node). 

## üîß Configuration

The best starting point to understand available configuration parameters is [this article](https://docs.waves.tech/en/waves-node/node-configuration).

The easiest way to start playing around with configurations is to use default configuration files for different networks; they're available in [network-defaults.conf](./node/src/main/resources/network-defaults.conf).

Logging configuration with all available levels and parameters is described [here](https://docs.waves.tech/en/waves-node/logging-configuration).

## üë®‚Äçüíª Development

The node can be built and installed wherever Java can run. 
To build and test this project, you will have to follow these steps:

<details><summary><b>Show instructions</b></summary>

*1. Setup the environment.*
- Install Java for your platform:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install default-jdk # P√ºtti: use the new jdk instead of version 8!
# old: sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jre                     # Ubuntu
# or
# brew cask install adoptopenjdk/openjdk/adoptopenjdk8 # Mac
```

- Install SBT (Scala Build Tool)

Please follow the SBT installation instructions depending on your platform ([Linux](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.0/docs/Installing-sbt-on-Linux.html), [Mac](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.0/docs/Installing-sbt-on-Mac.html), [Windows](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.0/docs/Installing-sbt-on-Windows.html))

*2. Clone this repo*

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wavesplatform/Waves.git
cd Waves
```

*3. Compile and run tests*

```bash
sbt -mem 2048 checkPR # P√ºtti: required to extend memory to 2 GB
```

*4. Run integration tests (optional)*

Create a Docker image before you run any test: 
```bash
sbt node-it/docker
```

- Run all tests. You can increase or decrease number of parallel running tests by changing `waves.it.max-parallel-suites`
system property:
```bash
sbt -Dwaves.it.max-parallel-suites=1 node-it/test
```

- Run one test:
```bash
sbt node-it/testOnly *.TestClassName
# or 
# bash node-it/testOnly full.package.TestClassName
```

*5. Build packages* 

```bash
sbt packageAll                   # Mainnet
sbt -Dnetwork=testnet packageAll # Testnet
```

`sbt packageAll` ‚Äåproduces only `deb` package along with a fat `jar`. 

*6. Install DEB package*

`deb` package is located in target folder. You can replace '*' with actual package name:

```bash
sudo dpkg -i node/target/*.deb
```


*7. Run an extension project locally during development (optional)*

```bash
sbt "extension-module/run /path/to/configuration"
```

*8. Configure IntelliJ IDEA (optional)*

The majority of contributors to this project use IntelliJ IDEA for development, if you want to use it as well please follow these steps:

1. Click `Add configuration` (or `Edit configurations...`).
2. Click `+` to add a new configuration, choose `Application`.
3. Specify:
   - Main class: `com.wavesplatform.Application`
   - Program arguments: `/path/to/configuration`
   - Use classpath of module: `extension-module`
4. Click `OK`.
5. Run this configuration.
